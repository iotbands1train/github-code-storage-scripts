/**
 * This class demonstrates the usage of the Player class by generating and
 * displaying player attributes. It also explores various concepts related to
 * class definition, object creation, encapsulation, and more.
 *
 * 9.2 Defining Classes for Objects The Player class is used here, which
 * encapsulates player attributes and behavior, following object-oriented
 * principles.
 *
 * 9.4 Constructing Objects Using Constructors Player objects are created using
 * constructors to initialize their attributes with specific values.
 *
 * 9.5 Accessing Objects via Reference Variables Player objects are accessed and
 * manipulated using reference variables in this class.
 *
 * 9.5.1 Accessing an Objectâ€™s Data and Methods Player attributes and methods
 * are accessed and called to interact with the objects.
 *
 * 9.5.2 Reference Data Fields and the null Value Reference variables are
 * demonstrated here, where they are used to refer to Player objects. They can
 * also be null.
 *
 * 9.6 Using Classes from the Java Library The Random class is used to generate
 * random values for player attributes.
 *
 * 9.10 Passing Objects to Methods Player objects are created with random
 * attributes and then passed as arguments to other methods.
 *
 * 9.11 Array of Objects Demonstrates the creation of an array of Player objects
 * to store and manage multiple players.
 *
 * 9.12 Immutable Objects and Classes Player objects are mutable here, but
 * concepts of immutability are relevant when designing classes.
 *
 * 9.14 The this Reference In the Player class, the constructor uses 'this' to
 * refer to instance variables while distinguishing them from parameters.
